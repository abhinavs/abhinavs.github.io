I'm a generalist with interest in entrepreneurship, programming, poetry, social sciences, emerging business models and emerging markets.

## A few more things about me

* I grew up in [Narsinghgarh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narsinghgarh,_Rajgarh), a beautiful little town in Madhya Pradesh, India.
* In my thirteen years of engineering experience, I have developed large scale data products, messaging systems, platform services, logistics and supply chain management systems, social games and social e-commerce systems.
* I can code in more than ten programming languages, and have written production code in seven of them. Currently, I am learning [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), a new functional programming language similar to ruby in syntax built on top of Erlang VM.
* I love building tools and APIs for developers, checkout my publicly available work at [abhinav.co](http://www.abhinav.co/)
* I am a big Gulzar fan, and I believe, he is one of the greatest poets alive.
* I love adrak chai and filter coffee.

## A few things I can't do
* I can't multi-task, I am extremely poor at it.
* I can't handle office politics, I tend to wither in such environments.
* I can't speak jargons - I don't sound sophisticated either.
* I can't play video games - tried as a kid, gave up pretty quickly.
* I can't get up early morning - well, I can if needed but I don't like to.
