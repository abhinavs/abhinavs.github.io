I'm a generalist with interest in entrepreneurship, programming, social sciences, emerging business models and emerging markets.

## A few things about me:

* I grew up in [Narsinghgarh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narsinghgarh,_Rajgarh), a beautiful little town in Madhya Pradesh, India.
* In my nine years of engineering experience, I have developed large scale data products, platform services, logistics and supply chain management systems, social games and social e-commerce systems.
* I can code in more than ten programming languages, and have written production code in seven of them. Currently, I am learning [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), a new functional programming language similar to ruby in syntax built on top of Erlang VM.
* I am a big Gulzar fan, and I believe, he is one of the greatest poets alive.
* I love adrak chai and filter coffee.
