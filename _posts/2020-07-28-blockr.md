There are distractions all around. Our attention span is continuously decreasing, and so is our ability to focus and do deep work.

<br />
blockr is a command line tool to easily **block** websites to avoid distractions. At the same time, blockr makes it extremely easy to **unblock** websites in case you need to access them. 

<br />
If you prefer a different workflow and like focussed and relaxed modes, blockr also lets you switch between these modes ensuring you are able to access blocked websites in relaxed mode - blockr provides **activate** and **deactivate** command to support this use case.

<br />
Please note this is alpha software, and is currently tested only on mac (Apple's OSX)
