Every company and entrepreneur needs a narrative to tell to the world. A good narrative is almost as important as an excellent product.

These narratives are forward-looking. They highlight the big opportunity and why the company is poised to capture it.

However, in an attempt to create a compelling narrative, entrepreneurs often knowingly or unknowingly exaggerate the companyâ€™s strength and hide the challenges or risks.

The biggest trouble happens when everybody in the company starts believing that narrative as reality. Mid-level managers and employees fall for this more given they hear it regularly in pep-talks. Companies become over-confident, underestimate the challenges they face, neglect org culture, forget about customer experience, build unnecessary & complex features, and get into mega-hiring spree.

This lack of self-awareness and humility prevents them from achieving their real potential.

This is a **chasm** that even most of the successful companies never cross. They never become truly glorious.
