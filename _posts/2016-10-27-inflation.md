We take inflation for granted. We relate it with growing economies, and we see zero inflation and deflation as a sign of stagnating or shrinking economies.

<br />

Inflation in elementary terms is sustained increase in price level of goods over a period of time. For example, last year, if one could buy 1 kg of apples in 100 rupees, and now if they cost 110 rupees, simplistically speaking, inflation in apple prices is around 10%.

<br />

Prices are usually decided by demand and supply equilibrium, and it is quite natural to believe that price inflation happens because of increase in demand which also indicates growth.

<br />

However, inflation can also increase if currency starts loosing its value. And when does that happen - when government start printing more currency than it really should. It helps in the short term, however in today's globalized world, it has a big negative impact in the longer term.

<br />

This is what distinguish money from currency. Money has the ability to preserve its value over the longer term, that is, unlike money, a currency is subject to inflation.

<br />

This is the reason Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to have a cap. More on Bitcoin in later posts.
