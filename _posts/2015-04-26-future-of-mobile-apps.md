* Today's desktop browsers are very powerful. We use them for communication,
entertainment and almost all our needs. And we use search engines
and social networks to discover websites and pages.
* Mobile OS market is pretty segmented with iOS, android and windows platforms.
It is difficult for app makers to develop, maintain and market native apps for all these
platforms.
* It is also very difficult for consumers to discover and download all these
special purpose apps. There are no equivalent alternatives for search engines
in mobile world.
* Mobile phones are yet to develop an app like desktop browsers - an app which
can become your interface to other apps.
* Cards presents a brilliant interface for other micro-apps to run inside one
app. Look at Google Now to experience these cards.
* I believe, these micro-apps are the future and an app, with the ability to run
these micro-apps inside itself, will rule the mobile world.
* Probably, Facebook and Google are already working towards this. Facebook Messenger has
opened up it's platform for businesses, whereas I think, Google is approaching
this as a technology problem and is trying to make chrome on android more
powerful and better. They also have Google Now which they can open up for other
third party integrations.
* The way these micro-apps will interact with users will be very different from
traditional pull based search engine model. Interaction will be more contextual and
personalized depending upon users' habits and preferences. It will also be
more pushed based then pull. It is the future of Siri too.
