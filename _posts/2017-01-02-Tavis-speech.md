Tavi, my 8 year old niece, gave a speech on New Year today. It was very well received, posting it here to preserve it.

<br />
Wish you all a very happy new year. 

<br />
As Mr. Borland, a famous American author had said - year's end is neither an end nor a beginning but a going on, with all the wisdom that experience can instill in us. And I agree. However, I also believe new year is another chance for us to get it right.

<br />
2016 was an eventful year, and today I want to talk about three major events which were important for the world and India.

<br />
In America, Mrs. Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections to Mr. Donald Trump with a very close margin. It makes me wonder if world's wealthiest democracy, USA is ready for a women president even after 240 years of independence!

<br />
India competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Brazil in August this year with a team of 117 members. However India won only 2 medals, a silver and a bronze, and both medals were won by girls. This makes me proud as a girl and an Indian. I believe, if girls will get better opportunities, they will definitely take their families and India forward.

<br />
One of the last key events of 2016 was government's demonitisation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in early November 2016. Though government's intention was novel, but implementation was poor. However, all citizens have shown great patience, and supported government in its effort. I hope India will see its benefits in 2017 and coming years.

<br />
2017 stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals. I have two resolutions for this year. 

<br />
My first resolution is eat more healthy and balanced food. In Hindi there is a saying "जैसा अन्न, वैसा मन; जैसा मन वैसा जीवन" meaning what we eat impacts our thoughts and our life. I completely believe in this, and therefore I have decided I will reduce my intake of junk foods like Kurkure and Chocolates this year. 

<br />
My second resolution is to play more outdoor games than indoor games. Outdoor games will help me make more friends, and interact with them. In addition, I will build more stamina, and also get more Vitamin-D, which will help me build more immunity. 

<br />
I know achieving resolutions is tough, but I will try my level best - who knows, someday I might win an Olympics medal for the country.

<br />
Thank You and wish you all a very happy 2017.
