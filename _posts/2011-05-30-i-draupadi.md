>Swayamara was mine
<br/>The decision my father’s
<br/>My life pledged to a bow and arrow
<br/>My life an offering to the <br/>shooter of fish
<br/><br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>All rights belong to husbands so says society,
<br/>But to be shared by five, – a commodity in the market place?
<br/>All this I accepted, became the wife of five – to each gave a son
<br/>I was the only wife of none.
<br/>
<br/>Gambling they went, invited by Duryodhana
<br/>Lost all they had, losing even themselves
<br/>I unspared was dragged into the court of men
<br/>Which were these bonds of Dharma
<br/>That tied my husbands?
<br/>What kind of husbands these, that are tied by the Dharma of lies?
<br/><br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>Started on our journey’s end towards the snow-clad Himalayas
<br/>I fell first, no Pandava stretched a hand
<br/>Towards paradise they walked, no one stayed by my side.
<br/>Then, I realised heaven too must be only for men
<br/>Better then to rest in the warm embrace of this snow.
